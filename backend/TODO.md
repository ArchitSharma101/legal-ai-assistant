# Backend Analysis Improvements Implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Clean Up Prompt Headers
- [ ] Remove emojis and special characters from analysis prompt headers
- [ ] Standardize headers to simple text (EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, KEY CLAUSES ANALYSIS, RISK ASSESSMENT, PLAIN ENGLISH EXPLANATION)
- [ ] Ensure headers match regex parsing patterns

### 2. Fix Regex Parsing
- [ ] Update regex patterns to match exact headers from the prompt
- [ ] Ensure proper extraction of EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, KEY CLAUSES ANALYSIS, RISK ASSESSMENT, PLAIN ENGLISH EXPLANATION sections

### 3. Improve Key Clauses Parsing
- [ ] Modify parsing logic to extract individual clauses instead of one generic entry
- [ ] Parse numbered clauses (1-7) with their sub-components (reference, explanation, implications, etc.)
- [ ] Structure key_clauses as array of objects with proper fields

### 4. Return Parsed Sections Correctly
- [ ] Update response to return parsed executive summary as 'summary'
- [ ] Return properly parsed key_clauses array
- [ ] Return parsed risk_assessment section
- [ ] Remove full analysis text from summary field

### 5. Move API Key to Environment Variable
- [ ] Remove hardcoded GEMINI_API_KEY from code
- [ ] Load API key from environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY
- [ ] Add proper error handling if key is missing

### 6. Add Response Structure Validation
- [ ] Validate AI response contains required sections
- [ ] Check for minimum content length in each section
- [ ] Add fallback handling for malformed responses

### 7. Implement Analysis Caching
- [ ] Check if document already has completed analysis before re-processing
- [ ] Skip analysis if status is 'completed' and return cached results
- [ ] Add option to force re-analysis if needed

### 8. Enhance Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Improve logging for analysis steps (start, completion, errors)
- [ ] Add specific error messages for different failure types
- [ ] Better handling of AI service timeouts and failures

### 9. Simplify Prompt Structure
- [ ] Clean up prompt formatting for more consistent AI responses
- [ ] Remove unnecessary complexity while maintaining comprehensive analysis
- [ ] Ensure prompt encourages structured output

### 10. Improve Output Phrasing and Spacing
- [ ] Enhance prompt instructions for better formatted output
- [ ] Request proper markdown formatting with consistent spacing
- [ ] Improve readability of analysis sections with clear structure

## Testing Steps
- [ ] Test analysis endpoint with sample document
- [ ] Verify parsed sections are returned correctly
- [ ] Check API key loading from environment
- [ ] Validate improved output formatting and phrasing

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All parsing issues resolved
- [ ] Headers clean and consistent
- [ ] Output properly formatted with good spacing and phrasing
- [ ] Security improvements implemented
- [ ] Error handling enhanced
- [ ] Caching prevents unnecessary re-processing
